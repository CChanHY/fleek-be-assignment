> We need to break up the generate_media_task into separate subtasks because generating media files and persisting each of them can be blocking.
  Once we generate the media files, let's trigger subtasks to save the generated media files to s3.
  Reference: To implement a Celery workflow where you first generate a list of items (like images), then persist each item in parallel, and finally run a callback after all
   persistence tasks are done, you need to **dynamically create a chord after the list is generated**. This is a common pattern, but it requires a small trick because the 
  number of subtasks is only known at runtime.

  ### The Problem

  You want to do something like this (pseudocode):

  workflow = chain(
      ImageGenerations.s(),
      lambda images: chord(
          group(persist_image.s(img) for img in images),
          all_done.s()
      )
  )
  workflow.delay()

  But Celery's canvas primitives (`chain`, `chord`, etc.) expect their structure to be known at the time you build the workflow, not at runtime. So you can't directly use a
   lambda in a chain to dynamically create a chord.

  ---

  ### The Solution

  **You need an intermediate task** that receives the list of images, then creates and triggers the chord. This is the recommended way to handle dynamic chords in Celery.

  #### Example

  ```python
  @app.task
  def trigger_persist_chord(images):
      header = [persist_image.s(img) for img in images]
      return chord(header)(all_done.s())

  workflow = chain(
      ImageGenerations.s(),
      trigger_persist_chord.s()
  )
  workflow.delay()
  ```

  - `ImageGenerations` generates the list of images.
  - `trigger_persist_chord` receives the list, creates a chord of `persist_image` tasks, and sets `all_done` as the callback.
  - The chord ensures that `all_done` runs only after all `persist_image` tasks are finished.

  **This pattern is discussed and recommended in the Celery community:**  
  See [Celery chain with dynamically-defined chord - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70294778/celery-chain-with-dynamically-defined-chord).

  ---

  ### Why this works

  - You can’t build a chord with a dynamic header directly in a chain, because the header (list of tasks) is only known after the previous task runs.
  - By using an intermediate task, you can generate the header at runtime and then launch the chord.
