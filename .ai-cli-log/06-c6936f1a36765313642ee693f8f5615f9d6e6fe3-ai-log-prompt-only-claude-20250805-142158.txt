Here are the **prompts only**, with everything after a `●` (and before the next `>`) removed:

---

> Refactor ReplicateService so we can use different providers. Let's make an interface called MediaGeneratorService, which ReplicateService implements. Also create a 
  FakeMediaGeneratorService which implements the same interface and returns hardcoded values. Create a factory that returns the concrete implementation based on configs. 
  Change all call sites to use the factory.

---

> try docker compose exec app (it's in a docker container)

---

> update .env and .env.development with the new setting

---

> Add a static file serving endpoint for serving static files like http://localhost/static. create a dummy image file to be served from http://localhost/static/fake.jpg. 
  have FakeMediaGenerationService return this image when called.

---

> don't update the config, just hard code it into fakemediageneratorservice

---

> keep the ability to return multiple urls. just add 2 more fake images with indexes and have the fake_media_generator_service return those

---

> we need to add the port number: "media_url": "http://localhost/static/fake.jpg",
              "status": "retry",
              "error_message": "All connection attempts failed",

> {
              "media_url": "http://localhost:8000/static/fake1.jpg",
              "status": "retry",
              "error_message": "All connection attempts failed",
              "started_at": "2025-08-05T12:10:05.572131Z",
              "completed_at": null
          },  but I can access the file at that url through the browser and curl
