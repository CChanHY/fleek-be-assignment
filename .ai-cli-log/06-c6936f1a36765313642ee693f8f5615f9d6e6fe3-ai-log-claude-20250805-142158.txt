 What's new:
  • Fix incorrect model names being used for certain commands like `/pr-comments`
  • Windows: improve permissions checks for allow / deny tools and project trust. This may create a new project entry in `.claude.json` - manually merge the history field if 
  desired.
  • Windows: improve sub-process spawning to eliminate "No such file or directory" when running commands like pnpm
  • Enhanced /doctor command with CLAUDE.md and MCP tool context for self-serve debugging
  • SDK: Added canUseTool callback support for tool confirmation

> Refactor ReplicateService so we can use different providers. Let's make an interface called MediaGeneratorService, which ReplicateService implements. Also create a 
  FakeMediaGeneratorService which implements the same interface and returns hardcoded values. Create a factory that returns the concrete implementation based on configs. 
  Change all call sites to use the factory.

● I'll help you refactor the ReplicateService to use a provider pattern with an interface and factory. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current
  implementation.

● I should also update the error message to be more generic:

       331                logger.info(f"Media generation completed for job {job_id}. Triggering parallel uploads.")

● Now I should remove the singleton instance from the replicate_service.py file since we're using the factory pattern:

● Update(app/services/replicate_service.py)
  ⎿  Updated app/services/replicate_service.py with 2 removals

       50 -  
       51 -  replicate_service = ReplicateService()
       50   \ No newline at end of file

● Let me check if there are any other references to the old replicate_service singleton:

● Search(pattern: "replicate_service", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 5 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Good! The references are only in the factory (which is correct) and in log files. Let me also check if there are any other call sites I might have missed:

● Search(pattern: "ReplicateService")
  ⎿  Found 3 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! All the references are in the right places. Now let me update the services init.py to export the factory function:

● Perfect! I've successfully completed the refactoring. Let me run a quick test to make sure the imports work correctly:

    lease remove it to avoid potential confusion"


● Excellent! The refactoring is complete and working. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

  Summary

  I successfully refactored the ReplicateService to use a provider pattern:

  1. Created MediaGeneratorService interface (app/services/media_generator_service.py) - Abstract base class defining the contract for media generation services
  2. Updated ReplicateService to implement the interface - Now inherits from MediaGeneratorService
  3. Created FakeMediaGeneratorService (app/services/fake_media_generator_service.py) - Returns hardcoded URLs for testing/development
  4. Created MediaGeneratorFactory (app/services/media_generator_factory.py) - Factory pattern implementation that returns the appropriate service based on config
  5. Added configuration - New media_generator_provider setting in config (defaults to "replicate", supports "fake")
  6. Updated all call sites - Modified app/tasks/media_generation.py to use the factory instead of direct service instantiation

  The system now supports switching between providers via configuration:
  - Set MEDIA_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=replicate for production (default)
  - Set MEDIA_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=fake for testing/development
  - Unknown providers default to ReplicateService with a warning

  All existing functionality is preserved while adding the flexibility to use different media generation providers.

       10    
       11    # S3/MinIO Configuration

● Updated both environment files:

  - .env: Set to MEDIA_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=replicate (production default)
  - .env.development: Set to MEDIA_GENERATOR_PROVIDER=fake (for development/testing)

  Now the development environment will use fake media generation by default, while production will use the real Replicate service.

> Add a static file serving endpoint for serving static files like http://localhost/static. create a dummy image file to be served from http://localhost/static/fake.jpg.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Add static file serving endpoint                           
     ☒ Create static directory and dummy image
     ☒ Update FakeMediaGeneratorService to return static image URL

● Perfect! I've completed all the tasks:

  1. Added static file serving endpoint - FastAPI now serves static files from /static path
  2. Created 3 dummy images - fake.jpg, fake1.jpg, and fake2.jpg in the static directory
  3. Updated FakeMediaGeneratorService - Now returns URLs pointing to the local static images, cycling through them for multiple outputs

  The FakeMediaGeneratorService now:
  - Returns http://localhost/static/fake.jpg for single output
  - For multiple outputs, cycles through fake.jpg, fake1.jpg, fake2.jpg
  - Supports any number of outputs by cycling through the 3 available images

  The static files are accessible at:
  - http://localhost/static/fake.jpg
  - http://localhost/static/fake1.jpg
  - http://localhost/static/fake2.jpg

> we need to add the port number: "media_url": "http://localhost/static/fake.jpg",
              "status": "retry",
              "error_message": "All connection attempts failed",

● I need to update the FakeMediaGeneratorService to include the port number. Let me check what port the application is running on first:

● Search(pattern: "port|PORT", glob: "docker-compose.yml", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(docker-compose.yml)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(docker-compose.yml)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! The app is running on port 8000. Now I'll update the FakeMediaGeneratorService to include the port number:

● Update(app/services/fake_media_generator_service.py)
  ⎿  Updated app/services/fake_media_generator_service.py with 1 addition and 1 removal                                    
       23            """
       24            logger.info(f"Generating fake media with model {model}, prompt: {prompt}, num_outputs: {num_outputs}")
       25            
       26 -          base_url = "http://localhost"
       26 +          base_url = "http://localhost:8000"
       27            fake_image_files = ["fake.jpg", "fake1.jpg", "fake2.jpg"]
       28            
       29            # Generate URLs cycling through the available fake images

● Now the FakeMediaGeneratorService will return URLs like http://localhost:8000/static/fake.jpg which should be accessible from the running Docker container.

> {
              "media_url": "http://localhost:8000/static/fake1.jpg",
              "status": "retry",
              "error_message": "All connection attempts failed",
              "started_at": "2025-08-05T12:10:05.572131Z",
              "completed_at": null
          },  but I can access the file at that url through the browser and curl

● The issue is that localhost inside the Docker container refers to the container itself, not the host machine. The storage service is trying to download from
  localhost:8000 from within the container, but the app is running in a different container.

  I need to update the base URL to use the Docker service name instead:

● Update(app/services/fake_media_generator_service.py)
  ⎿  Updated app/services/fake_media_generator_service.py with 1 addition and 1 removal                                    
       23            """
       24            logger.info(f"Generating fake media with model {model}, prompt: {prompt}, num_outputs: {num_outputs}")
       25            
       26 -          base_url = "http://localhost:8000"
       26 +          base_url = "http://app:8000"
       27            fake_image_files = ["fake.jpg", "fake1.jpg", "fake2.jpg"]
       28            
       29            # Generate URLs cycling through the available fake images

● Now the FakeMediaGeneratorService will return URLs like http://app:8000/static/fake.jpg, which will be accessible from other containers in the Docker network (like the
  celery-worker) since app is the service name defined in docker-compose.yml.
