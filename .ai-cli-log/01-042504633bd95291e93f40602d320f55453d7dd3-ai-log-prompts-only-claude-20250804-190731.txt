Absolutely! Here are the **prompts only**, with everything after a `●` (and before the next `>`) removed:

> Task Description

  Your task involves building a microservice that performs asynchronous media generation using the Replicate API, with the following features:

  1. API Layer (FastAPI)
  Expose a POST /generate endpoint that accepts a prompt and generation parameters.

  It should accept the following parameters:

  model: Name of the model to use.
  prompt: Used for text-to-image, text-to-audio, text-to-video, and text generation models. It’s the main way to describe what you want the model to generate.
  num_outputs: Controls how many results to generate (e.g., multiple images, audio clips, etc.).
  seed: Used for reproducibility in generative models (images, audio, video).
  output_format: Some models let you specify the format of the output file (e.g., jpg, png, wav, mp3).

  The endpoint should enqueue a job to an asynchronous task queue for background processing.

  A GET /status/{job_id} endpoint should return the status and result (if available). The result would be a link to the generated media file.


  2. Async Job Queue
  Implement an asynchronous job queue using Celery with Redis for both the broker and the results.
  Each job should:

  Call the Replicate API - use the python sdk. Reference: https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python
  Handle failures with automatic retries.

  Store the resulting image persistently.
  Update job status in a persistent store - use PostgreSQL).

  3. Persistent Storage

  Store the following in a database:

  Job metadata (prompt, parameters, status, timestamps, retry attempts, etc.).
  Create a Job model to store this. Include the Celery task_id as one of the fields.
  The /generate endpoint should create this record, returning the job_id
  Use Celery task_postrun signal to update the status of this job and url of generated media, and retry attempts, and any error messages.

  Store the media files using boto3 with minio - we'll change the url endpoint to switch between local storage and external s3 bucket.


  Requirements

  Asynchronous Architecture: All external I/O (e.g., HTTP, file, DB) should be async-compatible.

  Retries: Implement retry logic for failed jobs with exponential backoff. Initial backoff is 5 seconds. Stop retrying after the backoff is over 1 hour. Log errors.

  Error Handling: Gracefully handle and persist errors.

  Configuration: Use .env or similar config pattern for secrets and service URLs.
  We want these configurable by .env:
  create a .env.development file.
  s3 endpoint and credentials
  Replicate AI api token.

  Reusability: Design components (e.g., job handler, media client) as reusable modules.

  Clean Architecture: Apply principles of separation of concerns (API, services, tasks, models).

  Typed Pydantic models and response validation

  Dockerized setup - create a docker compose file for all services, plus the main application.

  Usage of Alembic for schema migrations

  Async ORM - use Tortoise ORM

---

> use int for job id. uuid is better, but for quick dev and demo purposes, it's easier to use.

---

> We should update the status of the job always, whether it succeeds or fails.

---

> when returning the media_url, use a presigned url

---

> We need to store the s3 key in the Job model. generate the presigned_url from the s3_key and bucket. then when we return JobStatusResponse, return the presigned_media_url
   along with the medial url

---

> {
      "detail": "Failed to get job status: column \"s3_key\" does not exist"
  }
